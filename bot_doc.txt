Hello friend!

Here's what I can do:

`!about` - The command that you just used, sends you my description
`!love` - I'm gonna tell you how awesome you are!
`!avatar @*user*` - Take a closer look at users avatar
`!wish @*user*/any word` - wish anything to anyone!
`!gn` - use this when you go to bedge
`!invite` - You can dm me this command or use it in any channel (nino-cries preferably) to invite people to play with you! Use `!ready` when you are to send a status report to everyone who accepted

Soon I'll be able to do even more..
